I found this challenge somewhat difficult, and received assistance from one of the tutors during this module challenge. 
While we had worked on similar exercises during class activities, they involved only one set of sample data. 
The tutor guided me on utilizing the forEach method to iterate through each sample data and employing a one-liner map with the arrow function (=>) to enhance the code's efficiency.
